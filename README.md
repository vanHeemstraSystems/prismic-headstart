Slicemachine isn’t the standard component library that you may have seen in the past. It is a tool that will allow you to improve your component workflow. From building the individual components to combining them into actual pages.

***Prismic*** is a **Headless CMS** that offers unlimited custom types, API calls, and a bunch of other great things. You should really check it out.

The problem is, API-based CMS’s have created a gap between the components and the data that they require and we wanted to bridge that gap.

We took our first step on that journey when we created our Slices feature.

With Slices, you can break your page content into JSON components that correspond to your frontend components. Each Slice represents the JSON model (content) for a given component.

Slices are one of our coolest features and a big reason why so many people are choosing to use Prismic.

But we wanted to find a way to take Slices to the next level and to allow developers to adopt a totally component-based approach to how they build websites and create pages. And that’s why we’ve partnered with Netlify and Nuxt to bring ***Slice Machine*** to life.
